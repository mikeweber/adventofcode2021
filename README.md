# Merry Gomas!

This journaling will be mostly for myself, but I'm posting it to GitHub for posterity.
This will be my 4th year attempting to do the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021).
I'm hoping to write down my thoughts as I tackle each challenge. This year, the theme will be
Go. I've used Ruby, Elixir, and Rust in the past, so this year I'll be getting in reps with
a new-to-me language.

## Code layout
With Ruby in 2019, I would write the code in different folders each day. Since it's a scripting
language, it was easy enough to just execute each program on its own. Last year, Rust required
more setting up just to run the code, so I decided to follow the same pattern this year, and run
a single command with an argument to specify which day's results I want to see. Running a program
requires running the "runner" program, but with different arguments. e.g. calling `go run . 01a` from
the `runner` directory will run the code for the first part of day 1, `go run . 02b` will run the code
for the second part of day 2, etc.
